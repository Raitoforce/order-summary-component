## My process

I first wrote my html structure with the BEM methodology to keep it tidy. In the end, I just wrote my BEM CSS classes. I started this solution 6 months ago, took a vacation, but came back to do more challenges.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - BEM
